# scripts
For all my scripts/programs.
honestly i feel like this description shouldn't be here, but if something doesn't have a clear purpose, and you want me to comment it out just create an issue or DM me at spiderfffun on discord, thats where im most active

It should download the zip of the whole project here: https://github.com/Spiderfffun/scripts/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
